First off, very thankful and excited that we get to work on the website together!

## Working Protocols

As we're all working on the website at the same time without built-in site-wide version control, things can potentially get messy. The main rule for development on the site is:
*always come to this repo and run `make` at the end of each work session, and make sure that the resulting PR is approved by the team lead*.

This will prevent us from accidentally making surprise updates to the production website that we weren't intending on making, and then accidentally leaving them there overnight.

And that's it - and so with that, let's code!
